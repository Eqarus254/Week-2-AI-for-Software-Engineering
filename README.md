🌍 Predicting CO₂ Emissions with Machine Learning
✳️ SDG 13: Climate Action

This project uses machine learning to predict carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions based on global indicators such as GDP, population, and energy usage. It supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action — helping policymakers and researchers anticipate and address environmental impacts through data-driven insights.
🧠 What This Project Does

    ✅ Loads and cleans real-world CO₂ emissions data

    ✅ Builds a regression model using Random Forest

    ✅ Predicts CO₂ emissions from GDP, population, and energy consumption

    ✅ Evaluates model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R²

    ✅ Visualizes predictions vs. actual values

    ✅ Reflects on ethical and environmental implications of AI
